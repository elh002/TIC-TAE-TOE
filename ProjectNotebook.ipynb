    "My project is about a Tic Tac Toe which is a 2 player game. Only two players can play at a time. I used “O” or “X” to indicate each player 1, 2. In this game, I use a board consisting of a 3x3 grid. Whoever places three respective marks (X or O) “OOO” or “XXX” horizontally, vertically or diagonally will be the winner.\n",

    "Game Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe first player plays with “O” so you can decide who wants to go with \"X\" and who wants go with \"O\".\n",
    "2.\tOne player can play at a time\n",
    "3.\tIf any of the players have picked a square/box then the other player cannot override that.\n",
    "4.\tThere are only 2 conditions that are “Win”, “Tie”\n",
